        "\n",
        "In this lab, we will embark on a mission to unearth valuable insights from the data available on Books to Scrape, an online platform showcasing a wide variety of books. As data analyst, you have been tasked with scraping a specific subset of book data from Books to Scrape to assist publishing companies in understanding the landscape of highly-rated books across different genres. Your insights will help shape future book marketing strategies and publishing decisions.\n",

        "\n",
        "In a world where data has become the new currency, businesses are leveraging big data to make informed decisions that drive success and profitability. The publishing industry, much like others, utilizes data analytics to understand market trends, reader preferences, and the performance of books based on factors such as genre, author, and ratings. Books to Scrape serves as a rich source of such data, offering detailed information about a diverse range of books, making it an ideal platform for extracting insights to aid in informed decision-making within the literary world.\n",

        "**Task**\n",

        "Your task is to create a Python script using BeautifulSoup and pandas to scrape Books to Scrape book data, focusing on book ratings and genres. The script should be able to filter books with ratings above a certain threshold and in specific genres. Additionally, the script should structure the scraped data in a tabular format using pandas for further analysis.\n",
